Example house
I found this example of a modern piece of architecture to be inspiring as I was trying to think of the style of my design.

Draft

A first draft of the blueprint
Here's a first draft of the blueprint of my house design. You can see the first level only in this snapshot.

Flat rendering
Here I am rendering out the different levels of the house straight on so you can see the proportions and scale. The angle is from the font.

Sketch

Angled rendering
Here I've rendered out the levels from an angle so you can view each level and it's full footprint.

Final

A detailed view of the walkway
Getting the details right is hard. In this rendering I show the wood paneling in my design.

An angled perspective
In this final rendering you see the full scale and context of the house.
