<b>WARNING:</b> Bloomcase is currently in development. You understand and agree that the Service may still contain software bugs, suffer disruptions and not operate as intended or designated. Your use of the Service at this stage signifies your understanding of and agreement to participate in the Service's development.</p>

<b>   1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS </b>

<p>
      Welcome to Bloomcase's portfolio mapping and publishing service (the "Service"). Your use of the Service is subject to these Terms of Service ("TOS"). Bloomcase reserves the right to update and change the TOS from time to time without notice or acceptance by you. The TOS will also be applicable to the use of the Service on a trial basis. By using the Service, you signify your irrevocable acceptance of this TOS.</p>

<b>   2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE </b>

<p>
      The Service is web-based and allows users that register for an account on the Service (an &quot;Account Holder&quot;) to create and update an online web portfolio on Bloomcase.com. Once registered with the Service, each Account Holder receives his or her own portfolio to post &quot;Content&quot; (as such term is defined in Section 7). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Bloomcase tools and resources, shall be subject to the TOS. In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or other access device. You also understand and agree that the service may include certain communications from Bloomcase, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Bloomcase Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Bloomcase membership and you will be able to opt out of receiving them. You agree not to access the Service by any means other than through the interfaces that are provided by Bloomcase for use in accessing the Service.</p>

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Bloomcase in writing of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.

In consideration of use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.
